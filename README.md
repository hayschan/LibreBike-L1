# LibreBike L1 LED Smart Emoji Tail Light

LibreBike L1 is an open-source LED smart tail light for bicycles inspired by the Magene L308 Bicycle Tail Light. It aims to provide a lightweight, customizable, and feature-rich tail light solution for cyclists. The project is designed to be accessible to everyone, with the source code, PCB schematics, and designs available on GitHub.

## Features

1. **Ultra-Light Design:** The LibreBike L1 tail light is designed to be lightweight, weighing only 50 grams. It's engineered to be unobtrusive and won't add unnecessary weight to your bike.

2. **ANT+ Battery Indicator:** Stay informed about your tail light's battery status using the ANT+ battery level indicator. This feature sends battery level information to your bike computer, allowing you to plan your rides better and avoid unexpected battery depletion.

3. **Type-C Charging Port:** The Type-C charging port ensures fast and convenient charging for your tail light. You can easily recharge it before your next ride, ensuring that you're always prepared.

4. **Customized Graphics:** Personalize your bike with customized graphics for your tail light. Just like the Magene L308, the LibreBike L1 allows you to add a personal touch to your bike and make it stand out from the crowd.

5. **ANT+ Capability:** Unlike the Magene L308, the LibreBike L1 comes with built-in ANT+ capability. It supports the Bicycle Lights (LGT) ANT+ feature. This enables wireless communication with a bike computer or similar controller mounted on your bike's handlebars. The information transmitted includes manufacturer and product IDs, battery level, light state (on/off), and flashing speed. The ANT+ bike light controller can provide real-time feedback to the cyclist and manage the state of the lights based on user input or automation.

6. **Device Dashboard:** Connect to the device dashboard using your phone or PC. The dashboard, powered by [Mongoose web server](https://mongoose.ws/) technology, allows you to customize graphics and adjust various settings for your LibreBike L1 tail light.
